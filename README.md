# The Vision
Taskly is built to be a perfect solution for small teams or startups that need a tool which enables success, but doesn't require a large learning curve. With a focused featureset and simplified options Taskly's "opinionated" approach, emphasizing the belief that a tool's effectiveness is enhanced when it's straightforward and devoid of unnecessary complexities. This philosophy underpins our design choices, ensuring that users encounter minimal friction while maximizing their efficiency.

Agile project management tools often suffer from high complexity and difficult learning curves, causing inefficiency, onboarding challenges, and wasted investment. Project planning is critical to a successful business, as poor planning and undefined goals contribute to a significant number of project failures.
